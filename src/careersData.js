eko is a media and technology company pioneering a new medium in which stories told in live action video are shaped by viewers as they unfold. Our award-winning shows are distributed through [eko.com](https://eko.com), affiliate partners, and social networks; and are viewable on desktop, mobile, connected TV’s, and VR.
        
We use JavaScript for (almost) everything, which means we’re looking for a developer who not only loves JavaScript but also has the passion, knowledge and ability to use it in ways that push the envelope of what can be done on the web.

At eko, you’ll:
* Use cutting edge and experimental features.
* Take JavaScript to the extreme. This means getting to the bits and bytes of rendering, I/O handling and data processing.
* Face the darkest corners of modern browsers and nodejs.

Sure, we use all the tools and libraries cool kids like (React, Redux, Angular, HapiJS to name a few...), but this shouldn’t be your reason for joining us. If you are all about creating mind-blowing experiences on the web, consider yourself invited!

eko is a media technology company pioneering a new medium in which viewers shape live action video stories as they unfold. Our award-winning shows are distributed through [eko.com](https://eko.com), affiliate partners, and social networks; and are viewable on desktop, mobile, connected TVs, and VR.

We’re looking for a developer passionate about new technology and willing to push the envelope of what can be done on the web. Our platform is mainly web-based, so you’ll be working heavily with JavaScript, as well as other web libraries and tools (React, Redux, Angular, Node.js, and hapi to name a few). Our ultimate goal, though, is to always be at the forefront of video entertainment technology, so we’re not tied to any one tool and we’re always experimenting.

At eko, you’ll: 
* Contribute to every part of our stack- from working with SQL databases to building microservices to crafting complex UI
* Have full ownership and responsibility over your feature work
* Collaborate with almost every other department in the company
* Become an expert in JavaScript rendering, I/O handling, and data processing
* Navigate the challenges of supporting multiple environments and devices like computers, mobile phones, tablets, smart TVs, and gaming consoles
* Help design and define what choice-driven entertainment really is, and what makes it tick

*(and the dogs, snacks, happy hour jam sessions, and general speak-your-mind creative environment will keep things interesting when you’re not JavaScripting)*

If you are all about creating mind-blowing experiences on the web, consider yourself invited!

##### Key Requirements
* Programming skills - deep understanding of at least one programming language. Easily able to identify and effectively communicate strengths/weakness in code. Experience with JavaScript a plus.
* Experience shipping code to production - experience writing extensible and testable software, contributing to and maintaining a production codebase, and analyzing performance tradeoffs
* Familiarity with software design patterns - experience designing scalable programs using common design patterns like factories, proxies, observers, etc. You’re comfortable with being handed a feature, designing the architecture for that feature, and knowing which design patterns to use to build an extensible product.
* Independence in uncertainty - you’re not expected to know everything coming in, but you should be able to become an expert in what you’re working on and share your knowledge with the rest of the team.

We’re looking more for how you work than what you’ve worked on, but we’ll value any extra experience with these tools we’re already using: 

* Client-side frameworks - React, Angular or Vue
* Node.js and server-side frameworks (Express/hapi)
* API design (REST, GraphQL)
* Architecture - microservices design, messaging (kafka/rabbitMQ/kinesis)
* Experience with building responsive interfaces for mobile, desktop and every screen dimension in between
* JavaScript ecosystem - packaging (yarn/npm), building (webpack), testing (mocha/jest/jasmine, headless browsers etc.)
* Experience and familiarity with the browser rendering process, Canvas, WebGL, shaders
* Infrastructure as code (Cloudformation / Terraform), monitoring
