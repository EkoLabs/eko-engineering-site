eko was founded by three bandmates who also happen to be good friends, and that’s exactly the atmosphere you can expect to find here – people working together using extreme tech to build cool products that people actually enjoy using. With that said, we’re a hard-core team of developers who take charge at work, manage our own projects from start to finish, and enjoy the freedom to choose what we work on and how.

We use JavaScript for (almost) everything, which means we’re looking for a developer who not only loves JavaScript but also has the passion, knowledge, and ability to use it in ways that push the envelope of what can be done on the web. Don't be concerned about that though, If you're more of a down-to-the-metal type C programmer or if it's really Rust you fancy - you can still fit right in. We care more about people and how they think than programming languages and what annoying syntax they might have.    

At eko, you’ll:
* Use cutting edge and experimental features.
* Take JavaScript to the extreme. This means getting to the bits and bytes of rendering, I/O handling, and data processing.
* Be the one that finds and reports the browser/Node.js issues that other people only search StackOverflow for.
* Shape the future of eCommerce - from content to commerce.
* Define the field of choice-driven entertainment.
* Be part of a team delivering features to millions of viewers.
* Be mentored by industry-leading engineers.

Sure, we use all the tools and libraries cool kids like (React, Redux, Angular, and HapiJS to name a few...), but this shouldn’t be your reason for joining us. If you’re all about creating mind-blowing experiences on the web, consider yourself invited!
