eko was founded by three bandmates who also happen to be good friends, and that’s exactly the atmosphere you can expect to find here – people working together using extreme tech to build cool products that people actually enjoy using. With that said, we’re a hard-core team of developers who take charge at work, manage our own projects from start to finish, and enjoy the freedom to choose what we work on and how.

We use JavaScript for (almost) everything, which means we’re looking for a developer who not only loves JavaScript but also has the passion, knowledge, and ability to use it in ways that push the envelope of what can be done on the web. Don't be concerned about that though, If you're more of a down-to-the-metal type C programmer or if it's really Rust you fancy - you can still fit right in. We care more about people and how they think than programming languages and what annoying syntax they might have.    

At eko, you’ll:
* Use cutting edge and experimental features.
* Take JavaScript to the extreme. This means getting to the bits and bytes of rendering, I/O handling, and data processing.
* Be the one that finds and reports the browser/Node.js issues that other people only search StackOverflow for.
* Shape the future of eCommerce - from content to commerce.
* Define the field of choice-driven entertainment.
* Be part of a team delivering features to millions of viewers.
* Be mentored by industry-leading engineers.

Sure, we use all the tools and libraries cool kids like (React, Redux, Angular, and HapiJS to name a few...), but this shouldn’t be your reason for joining us. If you’re all about creating mind-blowing experiences on the web, consider yourself invited!

eko was founded by three bandmates who also happen to be good friends, and that’s exactly the atmosphere you can expect to find here – people working together using extreme tech to build cool products that people actually enjoy using. With that said, we’re a hard-core team of developers who take charge at work, manage our own projects from start to finish, and enjoy the freedom to choose what we work on and how.

We’re looking for a developer passionate about new technology and willing to push the envelope of what can be done on the web. Our platform is mainly web-based, so you’ll be working heavily with JavaScript, as well as other web libraries and tools (React, Redux, Angular, Node.js, and hapi to name a few). Our ultimate goal, though, is to always be at the forefront of video entertainment technology, so we’re not tied to any one tool and we’re always experimenting.

If you are all about creating mind-blowing experiences on the web, consider yourself invited!

At eko, you’ll:
* Contribute to every part of our stack - from working with SQL databases to building microservices to crafting complex UI.
* Have full ownership and responsibility over your feature work.
* Collaborate with almost every other department in the company.
* Become an expert in JavaScript rendering, I/O handling, and data processing.
* Navigate the challenges of supporting multiple environments and devices like computers, mobile phones, tablets, smart TVs, and gaming consoles.
* Shape the future of eCommerce - from content to commerce.
* Define the field of choice-driven entertainment.
* Be part of a team delivering features to millions of viewers.
* Be mentored by industry-leading engineers.

##### Key Requirements
* Programming skills - deep understanding of at least one programming language. Easily able to identify and effectively communicate strengths/weaknesses in code. Experience with JavaScript a plus.
* Shipping code to production - experience writing extensible and testable software, contributing to and maintaining a production codebase, and analyzing performance tradeoffs.
* Familiarity with software design patterns - experience designing scalable programs using common design patterns like factories, proxies, observers, etc. Comfortable with being handed a feature, designing the architecture for that feature, and knowing which design patterns to use to build an extensible product.
* Independence in uncertainty - you’re not expected to know everything coming in, but you should be able to become an expert in what you’re working on and share your knowledge with the rest of the team.

We’re looking more for how you work than what you’ve worked on, but we’ll value any extra experience with these tools we’re already using:

* Client-side frameworks - React, Angular or Vue.
* Node.js and server-side frameworks (Express/hapi).
* API design (REST, GraphQL).
* Architecture - microservices design, messaging (kafka/rabbitMQ/kinesis).
* Experience with building responsive interfaces for mobile, desktop and every screen dimension in between.
* JavaScript ecosystem - packaging (yarn/npm), building (webpack), testing (mocha/jest/jasmine, headless browsers, etc.).
* Experience and familiarity with the browser rendering process, Canvas, WebGL, shaders.
